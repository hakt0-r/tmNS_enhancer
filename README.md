# tmNS_enhancer
A lightweight non-intrusive Tampermonkey [ https://tampermonkey.net/ ] script that enhances the user's site experience on newscientist.com

So far the enhancements are limited to...

1. Browsing past issues: Implementation of infinite scrolling and elimination of the years dropdown selector. 
2. Magazine style reading: When an issue is selected, the user is presented with a simple reading interface with the TOC on the left and the article loaded on the right.
